# Flight Simulator 2025

A web-based 3D flight simulator created with JavaScript and Three.js.

## Features

- Realistic Cessna 172 aircraft with detailed 3D model
- Advanced flight physics with proper aerodynamics
- Interactive controls for throttle, pitch, and roll
- Beautiful environment with mountains, forests, lakes, and clouds
- Fully functional runway for takeoff and landing
- Two camera modes: follow camera and free orbit camera

## How to Play

1. Visit the [Flight Simulator 2025](https://[your-github-username].github.io/flight-simulator-2025/) website
2. Click "Start Game" to begin
3. Use the following controls:
   - W/S: Increase/decrease throttle (engine power)
   - Up/Down Arrow: Pitch nose up/down
   - Left/Right Arrow or A/D: Roll and turn left/right
   - C: Toggle between follow camera and free orbit camera
   - Right-Click + Drag: Orbit camera (in free mode)
   - Mouse Wheel: Zoom in/out (in free mode)
   - ESC: Return to menu

## Tips for Flying

- Start by increasing throttle (W key) to accelerate down the runway
- When you reach sufficient speed, pull back gently (Up arrow) to take off
- Banking the aircraft (A/D keys) will make it turn, but also lose altitude
- For a proper turn, apply some throttle and bank the aircraft
- Try to maintain a steady altitude by balancing speed and pitch

## Technology

- JavaScript
- Three.js for 3D rendering
- HTML5 and CSS3
